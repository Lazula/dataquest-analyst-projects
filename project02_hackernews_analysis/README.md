# Analyzing Hacker News Post Interaction

Our goal is to see what kinds of Hacker News posts recieve the most comments,
and when. There are two different post types we are concerned with - "Ask HN",
which is a text post that asks a specific question to discuss in the comments,
and "Show HN", which is a link to content found elsewhere on the internet.

Please see the [project file](project.ipynb).
