# Identifying a Profitable Free iOS and Android App Profile

We are tasked with identifying which market segment of free iOS and Android
apps has the most potential for a profitable app. We are interested in
identifying an ad-driven app profile successful in both markets, so maximizing
the number of users is key.

Please see the [project file](project.ipynb).
